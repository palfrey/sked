    <p>Sked lets you solve the problem of "I have all these calendars and I want to share (some of) them with other people". It lets you take any combination of Google calendars
    and arbitrary other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> feeds and make new feeds that you can then share with people. You can also only
    share the "I'm busy" data from a calendar, instead of it's full data if you want, or just the full-day events (useful for work stuff where full-day disruptions should be marked)</p>
    <p>Once you've given someone one of these new feeds, you can always update their permissions
    afterwards - this means if you add new calendars, you don't need to tell anyone else. Also, if you gave someone too much/too little access, you can fix that.</p>

    <h4>Privacy policy</h4>
    We store various bits of your calendar data and will use it only for the purposes of providing the Sked service.

    For the sake of Google <i>maybe</i> getting rid of a really annoying page when you login, here's some more details that they want:
    <ul>
      <li>What Google user data is accessed by your application: your calendar data. All of it. Also your name/email, mostly for displaying it as part of your calendar info.</li>
      <li>How your application uses Google user data: we take the calendar data, and then share it as part of the iCal links in the app.</li>
      <li>With whom you share, transfer, or disclose Google user data: anyone with the hidden iCal links you have in the app. If you don't give those links out to anyone, no-one has access to it, so try not to hand them out to people you don't like. Well, techically anyone with the database root credentials does, but we don't give out the data to anyone else.</li>
      <li>Data protection mechanisms for sensitive data: security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of your data and we use encryption to protect your information.</li>
      <li>Information around the retention or deletion of Google user data: email <a href="mailto:palfrey@tevp.net">palfrey@tevp.net</a> and I'll delete your stuff.</li>
  </ul>
