    <p>Sked lets you solve the problem of "I have all these calendars and I want to share (some of) them with other people". It lets you take any combination of Google calendars
    and arbitrary other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> feeds and make new feeds that you can then share with people. You can also only
    share the "I'm busy" data from a calendar, instead of it's full data if you want, or just the full-day events (useful for work stuff where full-day disruptions should be marked)</p>
    <p>Once you've given someone one of these new feeds, you can always update their permissions
    afterwards - this means if you add new calendars, you don't need to tell anyone else. Also, if you gave someone too much/too little access, you can fix that.</p>
